Current project is the HTML/CSS Project from The Odin Project. This is my second official GitHub webpage project. Hoping to have improvements from the FreeCodeCamp one. I've been reading up on the "Getting started with HTML" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started) from mozilla webdocs. Super helpful and interesting. 

Downloaded python3.6.9 as well as virtual envwrapper and Django. Wondering if I could use those for this project or for the project and add it later.
